### Description

This pressure sensor from Goertek is a good low-cost sensing solution for measuring barometric pressure. If you need excellent accuracy and repeatability for altitude calculations, [you can't beat the Bosch BMP series](https://www.adafruit.com/search?q=bmp) - but if you are doing basic DIY sensing, this sensor fits the bill. We see it used a lot for DIY quad copter builds and environmental sensing.

The SPA06-003 can measure from 300~1100hPa (approximately -500 to +9000m from sea level) with typical relative accuracy of ±3 Pa (equivalent to ±0.25 meter) and absolute accuracy of ±30 Pascals, or ±2.5meters. Temperature measurement accuracy is ±1°C. As we mentioned, its not going to be as accurate or precise as the latest BMP series, but the price can't be beat!

Nice sensor right? So we made it easy for you to get right into your next project. The surface-mount sensor is soldered onto a PCB and comes with a 3.3V regulator and level shifting so you can use it with a 3V or 5V logic microcontroller or single board computer without worry.

The custom made PCB is in the [STEMMA QT form factor](https://www.adafruit.com/?q=stemma%20qt%20sensor), making them easy to interface with. The [STEMMA QT connectors](https://learn.adafruit.com/introducing-adafruit-stemma-qt/what-is-stemma-qt) on either side are compatible with the [SparkFun Qwiic](https://www.sparkfun.com/qwiic) I2C connectors. This allows you to make solderless connections between your development board and the SPA06 or to chain it with a wide range of other sensors and accessories using a [compatible cable](https://www.adafruit.com/?q=stemma%20qt%20cable). [QT Cable is not included, but we have a variety in the shop](https://www.adafruit.com/?q=stemma+qt+cable&sort=BestMatch).
